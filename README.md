### Hello! 👋

My name is John and I'm a mechanical engineering student who loves programming and data analytics. I am currently finishing my last semester at McGill University and absorbing everything I can on machine learning prediction models.

🌱 I’m currently learning:

Fun Artificial Intelligence algorithms such as hill climbing to solve TSPs.
Machine Learning prediction models, such as logistic regression, naive Bayes and multilayer perceptron.

🔭 Current personal project:

Stock sentiment analyzer: Classification of bull/bear sentiment on popular stock tickers - Python + scitkit-learn
